# OnlineTestClasses
Online test class by Enass Jasmine Loreen and Hoda

Our web app gives the students simulation tests.

We will have the following endpoints:<br>
/register => for the signup page<br>
/class => for the grades page<br>
/seventhGrade => for the Arabic, Hebrew and English tests<br>
/eightGrade => for the Arabic, Hebrew and English tests<br>
/ninethGrade =>for the Arabic, Hebrew and English tests<br>

Project's action items:
* When the student logs in, the app will set cookies, and when the user logs out, cookies will be powered off.<br>
* When the student clicks on his class, it will open the test's list.<br>
* We use joi validation for the login and the signUp files.<br>
* The username and its password will be saved in our database.
